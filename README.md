### How long it took me to finish this?
This was faster than rock paper scissors. I was able to use the functions a bit easier. The netcode looks pretty foreign but I just have to get used to it. Overall, it took me about 3 hours.

 The display 4 class edits how text and font appear on your sight without you having to do anything in CSS.
